# Project Pet Monitor - Portifolio 3 Semestre

The Pet Monitor system was created based on the need to locate lost pets through a locator that is inserted into their collars. The locator must send the latitude and longitude and, based on this data, a map of the pet's possible path as well as its probable location is generated.
Pet Monitor was created using PHP 7.4, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL 8.0.
